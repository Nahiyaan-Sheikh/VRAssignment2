I made a rube goldberg machine that is trigdgered by a swinging cylinder. This is the first phase, and it hits the first domino block which knocks down the rest. 
Then the last domino hits the sphere, starting the second phase. This is the ball rolling down the ramp towards the rotating block. In the third phase, there are two
rotating blocks which form a path for the ball to take as well as another push for it. The pushing block, or second trigger, keeps the rotating block from going too far, but it is also
restrained by a limiter. In the last phase, the ball rolls down the pathway, getting through the kinematic rigidbody that goes back and forth through a script. 
Lastly, there is a final trigger or pendelumn that takes the ball outside of the course, or the goal. 

I had some issues figuring out how to actually make the pendelumn swing around a certain point, while still keeping the stand up and frozen. Originally, my objects
were going all over the place as soon as I hit play.
Also, the lag here is just from the video again. This was the highest fps for the recording, my laptop is very low powered. The simulation runs just fine though.
